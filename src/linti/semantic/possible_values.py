"""The value model constant evaluation reports back through.

:class:`PossibleValues` is the single answer type
:class:`~linti.linter.constant_evaluation.ConstantEvaluationIndex` returns
and rules read through ``LintContext.possible_values(name, line)``.  It is a
*cascade*: a rule takes exactly the strength it needs, and each stronger
accessor is a refinement of the level below it.

1. **Exactly one value** — :attr:`~PossibleValues.exact` yields the sole
   fully known scalar, or ``None`` in every weaker situation.
2. **All possible values** — :meth:`~PossibleValues.all_of` /
   :meth:`~PossibleValues.any_of` / :attr:`~PossibleValues.values` reason over
   *all* possibilities — a single known value is simply the one-element case,
   so level 1 is contained in level 2.  Arbitrary predicates are decidable
   only on *fully known* values, so a partially known variant never satisfies
   them; for substring questions — the one family that *is* decidable on
   partials — use :meth:`~PossibleValues.all_contain` /
   :meth:`~PossibleValues.any_contains` instead.
3. **Partially known** — :attr:`~PossibleValues.partial` exposes the known
   fragments of a single half-dynamic string, e.g. ``sName = 'prefix_' |
   pDyn;`` keeps ``'prefix_'`` as a :class:`PartialString` rather than
   collapsing to fully unknown.
4. **Written at all** — :attr:`~PossibleValues.assigned` distinguishes "never
   assigned" from "assigned but dynamic".

Every query answers "is this *provable*?": an unknown — a gap in a partial,
an incomplete set, a dynamic value — never counts as evidence, so ``False``
always means "not provable", not "provably false".

This module has no notion of TI syntax or sections; it only defines what a
tracked value can look like and how two values fold together (see
:func:`normalize_string_segments`, used when concatenating).  Deciding
*when* to fold — e.g. that TI's ``|`` operator means concatenation — is the
interpreter's job, in :mod:`linti.linter.constant_evaluation`.
