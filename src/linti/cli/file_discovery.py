"""Centralized process-file discovery and path-exclusion matching.

Both the CLI and any programmatic caller turn positional path arguments
(individual files, directories, or glob patterns) into a single, de-duplicated,
exclusion-filtered list of process files here — file discovery is not spread
across the codebase.

Two rules govern all path handling in this module:

1. **Input semantics (resolution anchor depends on the source).**
   A raw path or pattern resolves against an *anchor* directory that depends on
   where it came from: CLI-sourced values against the current working
   directory, config-sourAced values against the config file's directory. The
   source is carried explicitly via :class:`PathGroup`, so the anchor is never
   guessed from the shape of the string.

2. **Internal representation (always absolute and normalized).**
   The moment a path is resolved against its anchor it is canonicalized with
   :meth:`Path.resolve`. Everything downstream — de-duplication, exclusion
   matching, the returned :class:`DiscoveryResult` — operates on that single
   absolute, normalized form. There is no variant enumeration.

Glob expansion happens in this module (via :mod:`glob`), anchored to the group's
directory, so ``linti lint "**/*.ti"`` behaves the same on every platform.
