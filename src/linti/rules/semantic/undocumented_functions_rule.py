"""Rule C430 – Do not use undocumented TurboIntegrator functions.

A number of TI functions exist in the engine but are absent from IBM's
documentation: ``DimensionElementInsertByAlias``, ``LockOn``, ``Hex`` and
others.  They work, and some of them solve problems no documented function
solves, but relying on them in production code is a bet: IBM makes no
compatibility promise for them, they can change behaviour or disappear in any
release, and support will not help when they do.

The rule reports every call to one of the names in ``UNDOCUMENTED_FUNCTIONS``.
Deliberate use is silenced either inline (``# noqa: C430``, also available
region- and procedure-wide) or project-wide by listing the function under the
rule's ``allowed_functions`` setting.

Like C510, the rule inspects the AST rather than the token stream: TI makes the
parentheses optional on a no-argument call, so ``LockOn;`` and ``LockOn();`` are
the same call and the parser normalises both to a ``FunctionCall`` — while a
plain variable read (``nX = IsNull + 2``) stays an identifier and is left alone.
