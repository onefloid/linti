"""Rule X210 – Filter ODBC data source rows in SQL, not in the TI script.

When an ODBC data source returns every row and the filtering happens only in
the TI script — via ``ItemSkip()`` or cube writes that are *always* guarded by
an ``IF`` — the server pulls rows it immediately discards.  Pushing the filter
into a SQL ``WHERE`` clause is both faster and clearer.

This rule fires only for ODBC data sources whose query has no ``WHERE`` clause,
and only in the record-processing blocks (Metadata, Data).

``DatasourceType`` and ``DatasourceQuery`` can be reassigned in the Prolog (they
are TI predefined variables); the runtime value wins over the process metadata.
The rule reads the override through the constant evaluation index.  A
``DatasourceType`` that cannot be resolved to a single statically known value
silences the rule (a genuine ODBC/non-ODBC ambiguity is not worth guessing).
``DatasourceQuery`` is checked more leniently: if a conditional override (e.g.
an ``IF`` with no ``ELSE``) leaves *any* statically known variant without a
``WHERE`` clause, the rule still fires, since that variant's rows are pulled
unfiltered from SQL on whichever path reaches it.
