"""Canonical ↔ deprecated rule ID resolution and validation.

The rule metadata is the single source of truth. Each rule declares its
canonical ``RULE_ID`` plus any ``DEPRECATED_IDS`` it has owned in the past.
This module derives the lookup tables from the registry once (lazily) and
resolves any user-supplied ID — from ``--select``, ``# noqa`` comments, or
``linti explain`` — to its canonical form, emitting a deprecation warning when
a deprecated ID was used.

A live canonical ID always wins over a deprecated alias: if a migration ever
recycles a number for a different rule, that number resolves to the rule that
now owns it, and no rule may keep it as a deprecated alias (see
:func:`validate_rule_ids`).

This module also holds the central logic for rule-group names and their
canonical ordering (``GROUP_NAMES``, ``GROUP_ORDER``), shared by ALL_RULES.md
generation and ``linti explain``.
